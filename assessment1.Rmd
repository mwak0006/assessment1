# Research Question

In this report we will investigate the energy production per capita of the countries in the G20 and how it has changed over time

# Data set Introduction

The dataset used in this report is from Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/energy
 and has been cleaned to contain

to contain data for each of the G20 countries energy consumption per capita and energy per gdp from 1985 to 2018.

The cleaned data can be accessed from "Data/owid-energy-data-cleaned-g20.csv"

The dataset contains the following variables 

```{r}
kable(variable.names(df),col.names = "Variable Names") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"))
```

- country

- year




# Data Set Description

The number of variables in the dataset is `r ncol(df)` and the number of observations is `r nrow(df)`
