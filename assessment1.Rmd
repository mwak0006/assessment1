# Research Question

Global energy demand has been growing consistently as populations increase and societies get wealthier [@OWD]. This report will examine the historical trends in population numbers alongside per capita energy consumption of the ten nations with the highest energy consumption in 2021.

# Data Set Introduction

The dataset used in this report has been extracted and cleaned from [Our World in Data Energy Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/energy).
It contains data for 10 Countries Energy Consumption in kilowatt hours (kWh) per Capita and population numbers for every year from 1985 to 2022. The cleaned data can be accessed and downloaded locally from [here.](Data/owid-energy-data-cleaned-top10.csv)

The data set contains the following variables.

```{r}
var_names <- read.csv('data/variable_names.csv')
kable(var_names) %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```


# Data Set Description

The number of variables in the dataset is `r ncol(df)` and the number of observations is `r nrow(df)`.

```{r screenshot, fig.cap="r inline code"}
knitr::include_graphics(path="image/screenshot.png")
```


The below table shows the types of variables and the first two observations for each variable.

```{r var_types, fig.cap="Variable Types"}
str(head(df,2))
```

# Data Summary
To examine the historical trends of population and energy consumption we have calculated the average energy consumption per capita and average population size for each country between 1985 to 2022. Additionally we have calculated the average growth rates for both variables over this time period. See \@ref(tab:table1).

```{r table1, fig.cap="Data Summary Table"}
df %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  summarise('Avg kWh/Capita' = paste0(format(round(mean(energy_per_capita), 2),big.mark=",")),
            'Avg kWh/Capita Growth' = paste0(round(((last(energy_per_capita) / first(energy_per_capita))^(1 / (n() - 1)) - 1) * 100, 2), "%"),
            'Avg Population (Millions)' = paste0(round(mean(population / 1e6), 2), "M"),
            'Avg Population Growth' = paste0(round(((last(population) / first(population))^(1 / (n() - 1)) - 1) * 100, 2), "%")) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable(caption = "Countries Average and Standard Deviation of Energy Consumption (kWh) by Capita and Population (Millions) from 1985 to 2022") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

The second table \@ref(tab:table2) aggregates the data on a per year basis and provides the Averages and Totals of Energy Consumption (kWh) by Capita and Population (Millions) Number for each year from 1985 to 2022.

```{r table2, fig.cap="Data Summary Aggregated"}
df %>% 
summarise('Avg kWh/Capita' = paste0(format(round(mean(energy_per_capita), 2),big.mark=",")),
            'Avg kWh/Capita Growth' = paste0(round(((last(energy_per_capita) / first(energy_per_capita))^(1 / (n() - 1)) - 1) * 100, 2), "%"),
            'Avg Population (Millions)' = paste0(round(mean(population / 1e6), 2), "M"),
            'Avg Population Growth' = paste0(round(((last(population) / first(population))^(1 / (n() - 1)) - 1) * 100, 2), "%")) %>% 
  kable(caption="All 10 Countries Averages and Growth Rates of Energy Consumption (kWh) by Capita and Population (Millions)") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")

```

**Observations**
We observe from the data summary that all 10 countries have **positive** population growth rates over the time period, however they do not all have positive growth in energy consumption per capita. Five countries; Canada, France, Germany, Russia and the United States have had **negative** average growth in energy consumption per capita. As an aggregate energy consumption and population numbers increased **positively** over the time period.

# Visualisation

```{r figure1, fig.cap="Energy Consumption per Capita from 1985 to 2022"}
df %>% ggplot(aes(year,energy_per_capita)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~country, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1985, 2022,6)) +
  guides(x = guide_axis(angle = 90)) +
  ylab("Energy Consumption (kWh)/ Capita") +
  labs(title="Energy Consumption per Capita from 1985 to 2022")

```

**Description of Figure**

* *Brazil, China, India and South Korea have steadily increased Energy Consumption per Capita since 1985. While Germany has been steadily declining since 1985.*
* *Canada, France, Japan and the United States Energy Consumption per Capita increased until approx 2003 then has steadily declined.Russia's consumption decreased until 1997 and has steadily been increasing since.*

**Figure 2**

```{r figure2, fig.cap= "Aggregate Energy Consumption and Population Numbers", warning=FALSE}
df_avg_sum <- df %>% group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise('Avg_kWh'=round(mean(energy_per_capita),2),
            'Sum_kWh'=round(sum(energy_per_capita),2),
            'Sum_Population_M'= round(sum(population/1e6),2)) 
  
  
ggplot(df_avg_sum,aes(x=year)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=Sum_kWh),colour="black", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Sum_Population_M*130),colour='blue', size=1) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    
    # Features of the first axis
    name = "Total Energy (kWh) per Capita",
    
    # Add a second axis and specify its features
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~. /130,name="Total Population (Millions)")
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1985, 2022,3)) +
  labs(title="Total Energy Consumption per Capita from 1985 to 2022", subtitle = "Aggregate data from the 10 largest Nations by Energy Consumption")
```

# Conclusion

In conclusion, our analysis of the 10 largest energy-consuming nations reveals intriguing trends in population and energy consumption per capita from 1985 to 2022. Notably, all countries experienced positive population growth, yet different patterns emerged in energy consumption per capita. Canada, France, Germany, Russia, and the United States displayed negative average growth in this metric. Brazil, China, India, South Korea and Japan demonstrated consistent increases in energy consumption per capita. Moreover, Canada, France, Japan, and the United States initially saw rising energy consumption per capita until around 2003, followed by a sustained decline. Conversely, Russia's consumption decreased until 1997 before steadily increasing. Canada had the smallest average population and the highest energy consumption per capita, while India had the second largest population and the smallest energy consumption per capita. These differences in energy consumption trends among countries underscore the variety of factors that influence energy usage.
